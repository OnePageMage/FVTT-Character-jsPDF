# FVTT-Character-jsPDF
FVTT Character Sheet conversion from JSON to simple PDF using jsPDF

I really don't know what I'm doing, having very little experience with javascript, much less json or jsPDF.
If anyone likes this idea and wants to do it better, go for it! You could probably do the whole thing in about a fifth of the time it will take me.

I'd like to request that if you do make something like this, whether it uses my crappy code or is built from scratch, please tell me so that I can use it too.
Also, I'd like to request that you license it to the public domain, CC0, but I can't make you do that.
